## Description
This is a portfolio blog I created as a part of my weekly indepedent project at Moringa School.

## Technologies Used.
* Html for page content
* CSS to style the page
* GIT is used as the version control for tracking changes on the local and remote repository.

## Procedure for development And deployment to git pages.
Html file first created to give the site a structure then styles added using css as the changes are being tracked continously using git.

### Follow along.

* Create a remote repository on github.
* Initialize a local repository using **git init** command on the project directory.
* Create the required html and css files and image directories.
* Create a new branch called gh-pages **git branch gh-pages**.
* Use **git add .** to add files and folders to git so that the project can be monitored then issue **git commit -m "message here"** to commit to staging area.
* Then connect with the remote repository **git remote add origin <url.git>**
* Then push to the remote repository on github.**git push origin master**.
